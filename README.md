# Semi-Dex  

## What is this?

This is a sample DApp project on Ethereum, built with Buidler, using Truffle + Waffle + Typechain stack.

The goal is to build an Uniswap-like decentralized exchange. It's not fully decentralized because the exchange rates and liquidities are defined by an Admin input instead of just managing with Oracles or others.

## Setup
```
npm install
```

## Test
```
npm test
```
